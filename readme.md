Covid Coupons are a means to support small businesses in your area that may be struggling due to closures and isolation of COVID-19. This plugin displays a form to use with Stripe.com to sell gift certificates for small businesses during COVID-19.

2. Download and install the WordPress plugin below.
3. Sign up for a Stripe.com account to accept credit card payments.
4. Complete the options in the WordPress admin page, including entering the API keys given by Stripe.
5. Enter the shortcode `[sell-gift-certificates]` in any page or post to allow visitors to buy Covid Coupons (gift certificates). You can otherwise customize the page using text or photos like a normal WordPress pagee.
6. After purchasing a coupon, the coupon code will be displayed on the screen, and emailed to the WordPress admin and the visitorâ€™s email address, if given.

- The current plugin uses the payment gateway Stripe. I am not affiliated with them. Your company is responsible for any of their fees. It is currently supported in the countries listed here. If it is not available in your country, contact me and I will try to add in another payment option available for you.
